            <p class="text-justify"><span>
                    Photography literally means drawing with light, so the importance of understanding this element
                    shouldn’t come as a surprise. The way light is used in a picture can be the determining factor
                    between a good and an outstanding photo. Start by doing some research on the origins of the camera
                    obscura and keep on reading about the characteristics of light. Once you have a general idea, put
                    everything into practice and see how each situation affects your images.
